        "I enjoy coding, problem solving and learning new technologies, and I'm looking for opportunities to grow as a software engineer and work on exciting and impactful projects. I aspire to be a Software / Game Developer. I had developed few games in UNITY earlier. I have exposure to Web Development with MERN and have made some projects (including this portfolio). I have hosted most of my projects on NETLIFY and VERCEL. I am also learning ML and AI and currently with a friend, I am working on a showcase website to host all our ML-AI models so anyone can test the models on our website. As our MAJOR project, my team and I are working on Computer Vision.",
        "I like playing video games especially competitive FPS games (Counter Strike 2) or Full on WAR Games (like Battlefield V) and simulation games (like Cities Skylines, House Flipper). I also like to listen to calm, slow music mainly non vocal EDM, POP, JAZZ or in some rare ocassions HEAVY METAL. I get happy helping others. I like cute animals especially cats."
